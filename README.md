# MT3 Challenge Using React + Vite

On this website I decided to use "Vite" as it requires less configuration, is optimized for a better user experience and offers an ultra-fast development experience thanks to live-reload.

## Steps to run the application locally:
1. npm install to install the project dependencies.
2. npm run dev to run the application on localhost:5173.

## How to use the app:
To start creating tasks you must select the add new task button represented with the "+" symbol. This will display a form with the fields 'Priority', 'Text', 'Status' and 'Date', you must fill out each field with the requested information and when finished you must click on the "Create" button, you will automatically be able to view your new task on the board.
Within each task in the upper right corner there is the delete button represented with the "x" symbol. Clicking on the delete button will automatically stop displaying the deleted task on the board.
If the description of the added task is very long, each container allows you to scroll to continue reading the text that is not initially displayed in the interface.
Finally, within each task in the center and at the bottom is the "Done" button, with which you can mark a task as done, and at that moment the completed task will no longer be displayed on the board.
At the bottom of the interface two counters are displayed, one counter for tasks marked as activated and another for tasks marked as done.
